//! `WsprController` — the beacon, as the engine sees it.
//!
//! Slotted like FT8 and shaped like [`crate::DigiController`], but with nothing
//! to sequence: WSPR has no addressing, no exchange and no QSO. What it has
//! instead are three things FT8 does not:
//!
//! * **A duty cycle.** A beacon transmits in a fraction of slots, not all of
//!   them, and it spends that fraction evenly: one slot in two at 50%, one in
//!   ten at 10%, rather than a coin flip per slot that clumps. Computed from
//!   the slot index and the operator's callsign — deterministic so the panel
//!   can say "transmitting next slot" before it happens, and salted with the
//!   callsign so two stations running this program do not start their cycle on
//!   the same slot.
//! * **Band hopping.** One receiver can sample the whole spectrum by moving
//!   between slots. The controller only ever *asks*: [`DigiAction::SetDial`]
//!   goes to the engine, which owns the VFO and refuses when the operator has
//!   a hand on it.
//! * **A slow decoder.** A WSPR scan is seconds of work over a two-minute slot,
//!   so it goes to a worker thread — and, because hopping means the dial has
//!   already moved by the time results come back, the job carries the dial it
//!   was recorded on. Getting that wrong would file every spot under the wrong
//!   band, which is the one error a propagation map cannot survive.
