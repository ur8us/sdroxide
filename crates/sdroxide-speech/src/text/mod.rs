//! Turning radio quantities into something a voice can say.
//!
//! # The output contract
//!
//! **Everything this module returns contains only ASCII letters, spaces,
//! commas, full stops and apostrophes.** No digits, no `-`, `+`, `%`, `/`, `:`,
//! and no `.` inside a number.
//!
//! That is not a style rule. The phonemizer downstream is a dictionary lookup,
//! and a dictionary has no entry for `120`, `-12`, `14.074` or `%`. An unknown
//! token is not mispronounced — it is *dropped*. A stray digit is therefore a
//! silently missing word, which in a frequency read-out is indistinguishable
//! from a correct one until the operator turns the dial and finds the wrong
//! band. [`Speaker::sanitize`] enforces the contract at the end of every method
//! here, and a test drives every rule through it.
//!
//! # Style
//!
//! Modes are read as letters — "U S B", not "upper sideband". That is what an
//! operator says on the air; "upper sideband" is what you write in a log. It is
//! also shorter, which matters when it rides on the end of every band change.
//! The exceptions are the ones nobody spells: `RTTY` is "ritty" and `HELL` is
//! "hell".
//!
//! Digits after a decimal point are read individually — "point zero seven
//! four", never "point seventy-four thousand" — and zero is always "zero",
//! never "oh".
