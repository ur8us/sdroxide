//! The band plan as data: band edges and sub-segments per IARU region, either
//! the built-in tables or whatever the operator has put in `bandplan.json`.
//!
//! ## Why it is a file
//!
//! The tables in [`crate::band`] and [`crate::band_segments`] are the *regional*
//! allocations, which is the most a program can honestly ship: national
//! administrations grant less than the region in places and more in others, a
//! licence class narrows it again, and the sub-band conventions inside a
//! country drift faster than a release cycle. An operator who knows their own
//! plan should be able to say so without waiting for anybody, and without
//! editing Rust.
//!
//! So the built-in tables are the *seed*. On first start the engine writes them
//! to `bandplan.json` in the config directory; from then on that file is the
//! authority, and every band edge, transmit lockout, waterfall strip and
//! skimmer window in the program follows it.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! One [`RegionPlan`] per region, each holding the bands, the sub-segments and
//! the two skimmer windows. The runtime form indexes bands by
//! [`Band::ALL`] position and keeps segments sorted, so the lookups stay cheap;
//! the *file* form is a plain list of rows in **megahertz**, because that is how
//! band plans are published and how anyone editing one thinks.
//!
//! ## Why a global
//!
//! Same reason as [`crate::region`]: the plan is read from three dozen places
//! that have no business carrying it as a parameter, a station has exactly one,
//! and it does not change under you. Installed once at startup and again on an
//! explicit reload. Every entry point that reads the global also has a method
//! on [`BandPlan`] taking it explicitly, which is what the tests use.
