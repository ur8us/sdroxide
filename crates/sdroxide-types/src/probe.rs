//! Asking a machine what radios it has.
//!
//! Every other setting in `radio.json` *describes* a device — a sample rate, a
//! gain, an address — and so means the same thing wherever it is read. These
//! requests are the opposite: each one asks a question about a particular
//! computer. Which dongles are on its USB bus, which serial ports it has, what
//! a discovery broadcast finds on its network, whether an address answers from
//! where it stands, and which sound cards the rig could be plugged into.
//!
//! They used to be answered by whichever machine the settings dialog was
//! running on, which is right in the shack and wrong everywhere else: a remote
//! client would have offered a laptop's built-in microphone as the transceiver's
//! transmit path and listed a dongle that was on the wrong bus. So the question
//! became a message. A [`DeviceProbe`] is asked *of the machine the radio is
//! attached to* — answered in-process by the native app, and over the session
//! by a remote or browser client — and comes back as a [`ProbeAnswer`].
//!
//! That is what makes an interface change reachable from away: choosing a
//! device is picking one out of a list, and until the list could travel there
//! was nothing to pick from.
