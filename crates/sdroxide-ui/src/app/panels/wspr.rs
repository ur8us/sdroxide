//! The WSPR panel: what got through, where it went, and what the beacon is
//! doing.
//!
//! Three panes. `SPOTS` is the list of receptions — one row per beacon heard,
//! or per station that heard *us* once the WSPRnet download is on. `MAP` is the
//! same world map the FT8 panel draws, so the two modes place stations
//! identically, with the propagation-heat controls above it. `STATUS` is the
//! beacon itself: the slot clock, the transmit duty cycle, the band-hop
//! schedule and what is being reported to WSPRnet.
//!
//! Wide enough, the receptions run full height down the left and the map takes
//! the top right with the status under it — the map is what an operator glances
//! at, so it goes where a glance lands. Narrower, the tab row picks one.
//!
//! There is no QSO pane because there is no QSO. Every control here is about
//! measurement rather than contact, which is the whole difference between this
//! mode and the one next to it.
