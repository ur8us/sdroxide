//! The Settings dialog.
//!
//! The window closure borrows `&self`, so it cannot reach `&mut self.ctrl`;
//! every edit is written into a [`SettingsIo`] and applied by
//! [`SdroxideApp::settings_window`] after the closure returns. That is also
//! where the blocking operations live — an HPSDR scan, a TCI connection test —
//! so neither runs inside a layout pass.
//!
//! Tabs that configure the *station* rather than this screen — Spots, FreeDV,
//! Uploads, Servers, TLE — are seeded from `RadioEvent::StationConfig` and stay
//! disabled until it arrives. They edit files on the engine host, which may not
//! be this machine, so there is nothing here to read them from and applying an
//! unseeded copy would write defaults over the real thing.
//!
//! [`SdroxideApp::settings_body`] draws the tab strip and dispatches to one
//! submodule per tab.
