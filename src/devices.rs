//! What this machine has to offer a radio: buses, ports, sound cards, and the
//! addresses that answer from here.
//!
//! One function, because there are two callers and they must not drift apart.
//! The GUI asks it directly (the radio is on the same machine as the dialog),
//! and in server mode the same function is handed to `sdroxide-server` as its
//! [`sdroxide_server::ProbeFn`], so a remote or browser client's Rescan,
//! Discover and Test buttons describe *this* computer rather than the one the
//! operator happens to be sitting at. Every backend is reached from the binary,
//! which is why this lives here and not in a library crate.
//!
//! Everything here blocks — anywhere from a USB enumeration to a five-second
//! connection test — so callers run it off their hot path: the GUI after the
//! settings window closure, the server on its own probe thread.
